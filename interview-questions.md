# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer:JSX stands for Javascript Extension which is a way of coding in React with HTML. To use javascript in React the code is required to be bracketed by curly braces {} which allows the code to function like it should in javascript.
For example : const element = <h1>Hello, name<h1>will not work  and just show text
            : const element = <h1>Hello, {name}<h1> will work because it is calling on the javascript function and making it more dynamic taking in multiple names or values.

Researched answer:
JSX is a syntax extension to Javascript which is used in React for the ability to fully use Javacript. JSX is used to be able to use the data while using React and this is preferred because it provides the ability how the code is handled and displayed combining HTML.

1. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer:Yarn : Const yarn = "You are really nerdy"
                "You are really nerdy" = Yarn is a package that contains extensions, packages, and programs to be able to run jest i.e. "Package Manager" Which contains prepackaged files and snippets of code for us to run tests with "Jest" Which is the ability to run tests for our code.

Researched answer:Yarn is a package manager with packets of code inside and can install packages and dependencies to test and solve issues with javascript. Yarn was created to operate faster and more reliably on a massive scale in providing a collection of dependencies, tests, and code than workflows before.

3. What is a React component?

Your answer:React is a program to build web pages and applications. Which uses smaller sized code (components) to bring and join together to form entire web pages, functions and applications. It is a premade program packaged (yarn) and is widely used and is a efficient in User interaction (UI).

Researched answer: React is used to create interactive UIs and makes it easier to create. It will update your application or web page quickly when the data changes and is also component based. Which means it takes smaller code and joins them together in creating a more complex function and or application. Many simple components brought together can make the most difficult task output clean and with easy with Reacts breakdown. React also helps identifying easy to fix bugs for the coder which is viable in building applications and websites and preventing blockage.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are data that is consistently changed or altered based on the UI code or           users input.  

            //This data can track a food order with a price, or the amount of exercise and how fast your heart beats. These numbers(data) is always consistently changing.
            
            Props: Props are components of small code designed for a specific purpose. This means that this specific purpose uses different amount of "props" to be pulled from 
            different locations of files in React to perform its complex task!

           // For example: When LEARN Cohort Alpha contributes in a check in or check out answering questions, we are not FULLY checked in or out if not all students and teachers contribute to the complex cause of a simple task.

Researched answer: Prop and States are related.  They are both used to pass data between ReactJS. Props are located in components folders and is usually pulled to App.js and States would be the "parent" component branching out to the "child" folders for it to be invoked and used.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a visual representation of code.  The code behind the scenes when looking at a application or web page. Such as facebook, Netflix and or other websites or applications.

Researched answer: DOM is a representation of code like a tree. HTML that is in react acts as a node which is a file or library for running websites or applications. Many nodes are attached to the DOM which combines and joins all of these HTML and JS files in creating the visual representation of the webpage or application i.e a Tree.

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: A div tag is a divider in  a HTML document that will extend to the end of the page from left to right. Basically a spacer between code.
A span tag is used to style and markup code giving it CSS visual alterations and decorating the webpage or application.

Researched answer: The difference between a div tag and a span tag is div tage is used to create space in code for HTML or even React and span is used as a markup tool to use CSS in HTML or React without having to resort to CSS file.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: OOP is a programming model that organizes design, data and objects rather than functions and logic. Rather than manipulating a function or code logic it focuses on the object which is a more dynamic for the ENTIRE code, program, and output. This works well if collaborating, and projects and groups where the code is reusable, scalable, and more efficient.

2. Ruby: is a porgramming language widely used in web app developments and data analaysis. It is used for web development frame works and practically works in any programming language. Its uses are web scraping, static site generationm, automation and data processing. 

3. Implicit return: A function that returns vaules without using return, and is used in a conside body.

4. Ruby blocks:are between curly brackets and can contain multiple arguments and is defined between two pipe | characters.

5. Ruby hashes: Is a data structure to store data in SPECIFIC key value data, unlike arrays it does not conatin no numerical indexes and is gained acess by "keys"
